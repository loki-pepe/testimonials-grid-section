## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I tried to get the desired layout using `grid-auto-flow: dense;`, but I couldn't get it to work the way I intended, so I finally opted to explicitly arrange the elements using `grid-template-areas`.

### Continued development

I would like to acquire a deeper knowledge of CSS Grid.
